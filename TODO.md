# TODO

Deferred work and known rough edges, grouped by area. Each entry is
self-contained — no external design-doc reading required.

## Packages / choice slots (parent members with a pick count)

- **Chooser own-cap footgun.** A choice slot is a package member that is a
  parent listing; its own `max_quantity` feeds the bundle cap
  (`min(own_cap, child_units) ÷ pick_count`). A chooser left at the default
  `max_quantity: 1` under a pick-2 slot silently caps the whole package at 0,
  with no save-time warning. Fix: reject (or warn on) a parent package member
  whose per-order cap is below its pick count.

- **`allocations` metadata length limit.** `enforceMetadataLimits`
  length-checks `items`, answers, `modifiers`, the entry count and the packed
  field, but not `allocations` — the fastest-growing field once every pick adds
  an allocation. A large multi-slot checkout can fail with a raw payment-provider
  error instead of the app's "book in smaller batches" message. Add
  `allocations` to the same length guard.

- **Capacity edge cases beyond the shipped model.** The shipped bundle-cap model
  (per-member child caps, sole-child pools, all-children forced demand) covers
  the common configurations but is not a full per-candidate feasibility solver:
  partial-overlap cases stay approximate — pool-subset unions (e.g. three pick-1
  slots over two 1-spot pools), a multi-pool candidate double-counted as
  alternative supply, and jointly-infeasible cross-slot mixes. All fail SAFE (the
  atomic submit write rejects; capacity is never clamped, only rejected), so the
  cost is a rare dead-end submit or an over-advertised bundle, never overbooking.
  Revisit only if a real configuration hits it.

- **Deferred choice-slot semantics.** Optional slots (a min/max pick count, e.g.
  "choose 0–2"); a per-slot "distinct picks" flag; per-package-unit pick mixes
  (today N packages × pick-K allows any mix of N×K picks, following the
  parent-quantity distribution); and a group-edit "add choice slot" affordance
  that mints the chooser listing plus its child edges in one step with sensible
  default caps.

## Listings offered under multiple parents / "can be booked by itself"

- No outstanding items — the row-identity fix (per-parent attendee rows, paid
  mapping by listing id, remainder rows) and the `bookable_alone` flag shipped.
